    DN_pleft  Distance from the mean at which a given proportion of data are more distant.
    
    Measures the maximum distance from the mean at which a given fixed proportion, `th`, of the time-series data points are further.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : array_like
        The input data vector.

    -------
    float
        The distance from the mean normalized by the standard deviation.
